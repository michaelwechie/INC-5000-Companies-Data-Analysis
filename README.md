# INC-5000-Companies-Data-Analysis

The INC-5000-Companies Data Analysis project was an interesting onen to work on using the R programming language for Data cleansing, 
ideally i received the data in its raw form and had  proceed witih the data cleaning process with R, 
the aim of this cleaning process was to ideally check for inconsistencies and anomalies like column repetition,duplicate data removing outliers and the rest of it,
making it much more pleasing to analyse and derive meaningful insights from to aid in decision making moving foward.

VISUAL REPRESENTATION USING POWER-BI
Creating visuals for projects are always fun for me as i love to explore the various possbilities that are available to me
While creating the visuals for this project i was tasked with showing and representing the following
* The growth by industry
* The growth by state
* The growth by metro

After careful analysis of the data 
Findings 1;
I found that amongst all the industries the one which grew the most was the consumer produce industry which has turned out to be a big business for investors in the period of time.

Findings 2;
I also found that California has been the most impactetd city in terms of growth with most of the operating firms either being headquatered or operating from california which which has drastically increased its growth prcentage on all fronts.

Finding 3;
I found that the top 10 companies that made the most revenue are either in the Health sector, Energy sector, Real estate, or Information technology which goes to show tyhe massive growth in these sectors respectively.

Findings 4;
I found that the real Estate sector had the maximum growth in revenue of all the other industries on the list showing the massive boom in the revenues being generated by this industry.

Findings 5;
I found the metro that has had the most growth has been the Los Angeles metro...now this is also as a result of california being the most impacted state of all the states in terms of growth of industries

Having these visual representations of our data will give us the desired insights we need to make the decisions needed going forward.
