# INC-5000-Companies-Data-Analysis

The INC-5000-Companies Data Analysis project was an interesting onen to work on using the R programming language for Data cleansing, 
ideally i received the data in its raw form and had  proceed witih the data cleaning process with R, 
the aim of this cleaning process was to ideally check for inconsistencies and anomalies like column repetition,duplicate data removing outliers and the rest of it,
making it much more pleasing to analyse and derive meaningful insights from to aid in decision making moving foward.

VISUAL REPRESENTATION USING POWER-BI
Creating visuals for projects are always fun for me as i love to explore the various possbilities that are available to me
While creating the visuals for this project i was tasked with showing and representing the following
* The sum of growth by industry
* The sum of growth by state
* The sum of growth by metro

Having these visual representations of our data will give us the desired insights we need to make the decisions needed going forward.
